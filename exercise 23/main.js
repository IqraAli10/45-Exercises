// Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. 
// Print a statement describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. 
// Your code should look something like this:
// let car = 'subaru';
// console.log("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
// console.log(car == 'subaru')
// • Look closely at your results, and make sure you understand why each line evaluates to True or False.
// • Create at least 10 tests. Have at least 5 tests evaluate to True and another 5 tests evaluate to False.
let two = 2;
let six = 6;
// Test 1 
console.log("Test1: Two is equals to 2");
console.log(two == 2);
// Test 2
console.log("Test2: Two is equals to 6");
console.log(two == 6);
// Test 3
console.log("Test3: six is equals to 6");
console.log(six == 6);
// Test 4
console.log("Test4: Two is not equals to 6");
console.log(two !== 6);
// Test 5
console.log("Test5: Two is less then 6");
console.log(two < 6);
// Test 6
console.log("Test6: Two is greater then 6");
console.log(two > 6);
// Test 7
console.log("Test7: Two is equals to 6");
console.log(two == 6);
// Test 8

// Test 9

// Test 10
